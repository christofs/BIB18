Each node is one editor, and each time two people have co-edited a publication, a link between them is created. The more co-editorships a person accumulates, the larger the node. The more co-editorships two people share, the thicker the edge connecting them. For this visualization, the full data of collaborations for edited volumes and editions has been massively reduced. Different parameters may strongly affect the results. See the full coeditor data in the `data` folder for more details.  \n",

Inversely, the most intense collaboration appears to be between Herman and Pelckmans, who seem to avoid one-off collaborations. Finally, Rosset also functions as a bridge linking Porret and Baczko on the one hand, and Herman and Pelckmans on the other hand, and their respective coeditor networks. No similar bridge exists towards the Leuwers et al. network. The smaller Didier cluster is also connected to Sermain.  \n"
