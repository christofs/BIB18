Website containing data and analyses of the dataset derived from the *Bibliographie sur le XVIIIe siècle*. 

## Orientation 

Source of the data: Benoît Melançon, for background information see [mapageweb.umontreal.ca/melancon/donnees_biblios_1_550.html](http://mapageweb.umontreal.ca/melancon/donnees_biblios_1_550.html) and for the Dataverse deposit, see [doi.org/10.5683/SP3/PYYEEH](https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/PYYEEH). 

For more information on the transformation process, and to obtain the dataset in various formats (BibTeX, Zotero RDF, JSON), see: [github.com/christofs/BIB18](https://github.com/christofs/BIB18). The transformation was performed in May 2023. 

The resulting bibliography can be consulted on Zotero, see: [zotero.org/groups/5067408/BIB18](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5067408/BIB18).

Some analyses of the dataset are available on the present website. The scripts to create the analyses and generate the website pages is also available at [github.com/christofs/BIB18](https://github.com/christofs/BIB18).

# Analyses of the 'Bibliographie: XVIIIe' dataset 

The analyses are based on the RDF version of the data (currently, v0.1.0, May 20, 2023) and have been performed by Christof Schöch. 

Note that all numbers can be expected to shift slighly as the process of cleaning the data proceeds. Collaborative authorship / editorship as well as the publication types will most likely be most affected by corrections. 


## Distribution of publications per year 

The dataset contains 64169 publication years, with 87 different publication years recorded (some of them are errors). Here, only data starting in 1986 is shown (the bibliography was launched in 1992).

## Distribution of publication types in the dataset

There are 64397 instances of publication type (each entry has one), with just 6 different types of publication types. This number results from the original bibliography's data model, but the labels used below are Zotero's labels. The exception to this rule is that the distinction between monographs and edited volumes is lost in Zotero, which considers both to be books.  

- journalArticle: 26615
- book (monographs and edited volumes): 23083
- bookSection: 13368
- thesis: 1296
- dataset: 34
- webpage: 1

(Visualize as a bubble chart?)

## Distribution of languages in the dataset 

There are 64396 instances of the `language` element in the dataset. For the moment, only 8 different languages have been identified, although there are no doubt more languages represented in the dataset. (These will be added with further refinement of the data.)

Few surprises in the major languages so far: French reigns supreme, before English, with Italian, German and Spanish quite a bit behind.
